इन उल्लंघनों में लापरवाही से ड्राइविंग करना, रेड लाइट पार करना, अत्यधिक गति से वाहन चलाना और पैदल यात्रियों को खतरे में डालना शामिल है। इस प्रकार का व्यवहार न केवल अन्य वाहन चालकों को असुविधा पहुँचा रहा है, बल्कि गंभीर दुर्घटनाओं और चोटों का कारण बन सकता है।  

मैं आपसे निवेदन करता/करती हूं कि कृपया इस मामले की जांच करें और मोटर वाहन अधिनियम की संबंधित धाराओं के तहत उचित कानूनी और प्रशासनिक कार्रवाई करें। आवश्यकता पड़ने पर मैं आगे की जानकारी या गवाह बयान देने के लिए तैयार हूं।  

मुझे आशा है कि सड़क सुरक्षा और अनुशासन बनाए रखने हेतु शीघ्र कार्रवाई की जाएगी।

विषय: आईपीसी की धारा 354 के अंतर्गत यौन उत्पीड़न की शिकायत

मान्यवर/मान्यवरिणी,

मैं आपके संज्ञान में यह लाना चाहती/चाहता हूँ कि मुझे एक उत्पीड़न की घटना का सामना करना पड़ा है। [तारीख] को, जब मैं [स्थान] पर थी, तब एक व्यक्ति (यदि नाम ज्ञात हो) ने बार-बार अश्लील टिप्पणियाँ कीं और मेरी सहमति के बिना मुझे शारीरिक रूप से छूने की कोशिश की।

इस घटना से मुझे अत्यधिक मानसिक तनाव, डर और असुरक्षा की भावना हुई। मेरे पास इस घटना के स्क्रीनशॉट/फोटो हैं और कुछ गवाह भी हैं जो इस बात की पुष्टि कर सकते हैं।

यह व्यवहार भारतीय दंड संहिता की धारा 354 का स्पष्ट उल्लंघन है, जो महिलाओं को छेड़छाड़ और हमलों से सुरक्षा प्रदान करती है। मैं निवेदन करती/करता हूँ कि इस पर तुरंत एफआईआर दर्ज कर उचित कानूनी कार्रवाई की जाए।

मैं अपना बयान दर्ज कराने और आवश्यक सहयोग प्रदान करने के लिए तैयार हूँ।

धन्यवाद।

వాహన దుర్వినియోగం, రెడ్ సిగ్నల్ దాటి వెళ్లడం, వేగంగా నడపడం మరియు పాదచారుల్ని ప్రమాదంలో పడేసే చర్యలు అతను చేస్తున్న ఉల్లంఘనలలో ఉన్నాయి। ఈ చర్యల వల్ల ఇతర రోడ్డు ప్రయాణికులకు అసౌకర్యం కలిగినదేగాకా, తీవ్రమైన ప్రమాదాల అవకాశాలూ పెరుగుతున్నాయి।  

దయచేసి మీరు ఈ విషయాన్ని విచారించి, మోటార్ వాహనాల చట్టం ప్రకారం తగిన న్యాయపరమైన మరియు పరిపాలనా చర్యలు తీసుకోవాలని కోరుతున్నాను। అవసరమైతే నేను మరింత సమాచారం లేదా సాక్ష్యం ఇవ్వడానికి సిద్ధంగా ఉన్నాను।  

రోడ్డు భద్రత కోసం తక్షణ చర్య తీసుకుంటారని ఆశిస్తున్నాను।

విషయం: IPC సెక్షన్ 354 ప్రకారం లైంగిక వేధింపులపై ఫిర్యాదు

గౌరవనీయులారా,

నేను ఈ లేఖ ద్వారా నాకు జరిగిన వేధింపుల ఘటనను మీ దృష్టికి తీసుకురావాలనుకుంటున్నాను. [తేదీ]న, నేను [ప్రదేశం]లో ఉన్నప్పుడు, ఒక వ్యక్తి (పేరు తెలియలేకపోతే పేర్కొనండి) నన్ను అనుచితంగా టిప్పణులు చేస్తూ, నా అనుమతి లేకుండా శారీరకంగా తాకేందుకు ప్రయత్నించాడు.

ఈ సంఘటన నాకు తీవ్రమైన మానసిక వేదన, భయం మరియు అసురక్షిత భావన కలిగించింది. ఈ ఘటనకు సంబంధించిన స్క్రీన్‌షాట్లు/ఫొటోలు మరియు ప్రమాణాలను ఇచ్చే ప్రత్యక్ష సాక్షులు నాకు ఉన్నాయి.

ఈ ప్రవర్తన భారతీయ శిక్షాస్మృతి సెక్షన్ 354 ప్రకారం మహిళలపై దాడులు మరియు వేధింపులను నిరోధించే చట్టానికి వ్యతిరేకంగా ఉంటుంది. దయచేసి నిందితుడిపై తక్షణమే FIR నమోదు చేసి, తగిన చట్టపరమైన చర్య తీసుకోవాలని కోరుతున్నాను.

నేను నా స్టేట్మెంట్ ఇవ్వడానికి మరియు అవసరమైన సహాయాన్ని అందించడానికి సిద్ధంగా ఉన్నాను.

ధన్యవాదాలు.
